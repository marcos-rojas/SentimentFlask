We need to pass the unstructured data
into classification/categorie labels. It
makes easy to do calculation as well as
understand data (what is client trying to
communicate)
PROCESS:
INPUT->TEXT ANALYTICS -> CLASSIFIER -> OUTPUT

.Input: raw unstructured data
.textAnalytics: stemming, POS tagging, stopwords, lemmatization
.classifier: decision tree/navide bayes, SVM, random Forest
.output: category if data
